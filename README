Mumble statistics
=================
A php project to visualize Mumble usage data.

Copyright 2009-2010 Sascha Jüngling <sjuengling@gmail.com>

INSTALL/SETUP:

In order for this script to work, you need to have a file called "db_credentials.php" in the
document root, which initializes the variables $db_name, $db_host, $db_user, and $db_pass with
the according values to access the mumble usage data.

The "cache/" folder and its files need to be writable by the webserver, for caching to work.

License information will follow, as soon as I have made up my mind about it. ;)
