    <title>Mumble statistics - explanation</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  <p>The statistics you are currently looking at represent a part of Mumble's userbase and gives the developers
  valuable information about the systems Mumble is run on. The more the developers know what systems mumble
  is run on, the better they can concentrate their development efforts to satisfy the user's needs.</p>
  
  The statistics shown here don't represent the complete Mumble userbase. Counted in are only people who
  <ul>
    <li>are using mumble version 1.1.7 or higher</li>
    <li>opted to have their information submitted to the statistics pool (can be toggled via the configuration menu)</li>
    <li>have their Mumble client running for at least 10 minutes continuously</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Also, every user is counted only once and is not based on the number of times a client sends a data submission. User identification is based on an anonymized unique identifier. If a client which has reported data before submits another set of data, the one in the database will be updated with the new information, if there is any.</p>
  
  <p>The figures shown in the statistics might sometimes not add up properly. This is due to several filters applied as default. For example, the diagram about which versions and snapshots are in use might show less total users than the total dataset count says at the top. As the version and snapshot usage does not show user compiled versions of Mumble, these figures are lower than the rest. However, for the operating system, Qt version and all the other statistics, the data from user-compiled versions are counted in so we don't miss out on any details.</p>
